						<h2>
							About The Project
						</h2>
						<p>
							TUMZ is a customizable tracking health resource for users with GI health disorders to track their symptoms and better understand their own individual condition. Offering Coaching Services, Tracking with pattern recognition, and access to a toolkit for flare ups.
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>
							Problem Statement
						</h2>
						<p>
							Gut health-interested people need a way to track their data for their gut health journey to fit their personal needs. There are not many application options for people with chronic gut health conditions to rely on to help them better their condition and better understand their body's triggers and symptoms, leading us to create TUMZ.

              We will know this to be true when we see that people can track and overview their data on their conditions and receive helpful personalized guides on how to cope while also having access to in-app recognition of any patterns regarding symptoms to possible triggers.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>
							Solution
						</h2>
						<p>
							An app that provides useful resources and tracking methods for people with chronic gut health conditions to be able to track their data daily and have a better understanding of their gut health and what their triggers may be. It will also provide a reliable tool kit full of helpful coping methods that users will have access to any time they are experiencing a flare-up and informational pages they can read to help them better understand their condition.

					<div>
						<div>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>
								Within our Market Research process for TUMZ, we conducted a Competitive Analysis’ to get an idea of what other applications with similar purposes are out there. Within each of the competitor application’s strengths and weaknesses is valuable insight on what we can utilize to make TUMZ more effective and also what we can withhold from adding to avoid unnecessary features. 
							</p>

								Ideation
							</h2>
							<p>
								After gathering all the needed information about the users and understanding their main needs, I created a user flow, with three defined keys: create an account, enter in tracking data, and how to utilize the toolkit.

							<h2>
								Wireframes
							</h2>
							<p>
								Using the tool Procreate, I created the low-fidelity wireframes of TUMZ. Within this process, I mainly focused on the Mobile Coaching, Mobile Tracking, and Mobile Toolkit sections of the application. After designing an overall layout for each feature I moved on to creating Mid-Fidelity Wireframes using Figma.
